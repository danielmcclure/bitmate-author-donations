BitMate Author Donations is a WordPress plugin for authors on WordPress powered sites to accept cryptocurrency donations.

== Description ==

BitMate Author Donations is a WordPress plugin for authors on WordPress powered sites to accept cryptocurrency donations. It can automatically add a cryptocurrency donation box below all posts, or can be manually controlled via the built in shortcode `[bitmate-author-donate]` and/or widgets for sidebars and visual page builders. 

Here are a few of the special features you might not notice at first:

* Can be used in "Maximalist" Bitcoin only mode with classic styles or will adapt to a modern multi-currency display when you add other currencies.
* Sets Bitcoin label & message when using compatible installed wallets.
* Makes use of compatible URI formats where possible, for example [BIP 21 for Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki).
* Uses local and self-hosted fonts to avoid calling other servers.
* Works without Javascript enabled - although offers optimisations when it is!
* Makes use of open-source self-hosted QR code generator for increase privacy.

**Coming Soon:**

* International translation hooks
